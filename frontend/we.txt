see i m facing issue in deployment(MERN PROJECT), like the frontend n backend are separately deployed on vercel n render, now  i have on my level tried to replace the local links to deployed links but still facing the issues,

main issue i can observe - that registeration page should open only when the user is new, for old user(in the database) can serve the web app handy.

in console error -
Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
